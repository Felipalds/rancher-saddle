# Product Documentation

## Vision

rancher-saddle automates Kubernetes cluster deployment on cloud infrastructure. It targets engineers who need to quickly spin up RKE2/K3s clusters with Rancher for development, testing, or demos — without manually writing Terraform and Ansible.

## Scope

- **Cloud providers**: AWS EC2 (extensible to Azure, GCP, vSphere)
- **K8s distributions**: RKE2, K3s (extensible to kubeadm, minikube)
- **Management plane**: Rancher (standard and Prime)
- **Interface**: Fullscreen TUI (primary), CLI commands (secondary)

## Features

### UX Decisions

| Decision | Choice | Reason |
|---|---|---|
| TUI framework | Bubbletea | Best Go TUI framework, Elm architecture |
| Log panel size | 33% of terminal | Enough to read logs without losing cluster context |
| Auto-refresh | 1 second interval | Fast feedback without flickering |
| Keybinding style | Single keys + Ctrl combos | Vim-inspired, discoverable via footer |
| Delete confirmation | Modal with y/n | Prevents accidental infrastructure destruction |
| Background operations | Goroutines | Non-blocking TUI during long deploy/delete |
| Cluster sort | Alphabetical | Stable row order across refreshes |

### Keybindings (Cluster List)

| Key | Action |
|---|---|
| `n` / `c` | Create new cluster |
| `x` | Delete selected cluster |
| `u` | Upgrade Rancher (if deployed) |
| `Enter` | Toggle log viewer |
| `Ctrl+X` | Manage credentials |
| `Ctrl+P` | Manage profiles |
| `Ctrl+A` | AMI catalog |
| `?` | Help |
| `q` / `Ctrl+C` | Quit |

## Rancher Prime vs Standard

| Setting | Rancher Prime | Rancher (Latest) |
|---|---|---|
| Helm repo | `rancher-prime` from `charts.rancher.com` | `rancher-latest` from `releases.rancher.com` |
| Container image | `registry.suse.com/rancher/rancher` | Default upstream |
| System registry | `registry.suse.com` | Not set |
| Extra env vars | `CATTLE_DEBUG`, `RANCHER_VERSION_TYPE=prime`, `CATTLE_BASE_UI_BRAND=suse` | Not set |

- [ ] New cloud providers (Azure, GCP, vSphere)
- [ ] Monitoring stack deployment (Prometheus, Grafana)
- [ ] Cluster scaling (add/remove nodes post-deploy)
- [ ] Import existing clusters
